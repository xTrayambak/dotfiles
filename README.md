# My NixOS dotfiles
This is my 2nd attempt at NixOS, going better than my first run which was done completely blindly and ended... badly to say the least.

# Acknowledgements
A lot of things here are just cobbled from different places, and I've forgotten most of them.

I used [fufexan's dotfiles](https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles) to set up a flake.
I used [justinlime's dotfiles](https://github.com/justinlime/dotfiles) to set up some other stuff.
